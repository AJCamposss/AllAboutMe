Team player with great communication skills, high quality of work, motivated to succeed, and able to work independently. These skills were further developed in my High School Metro Tech Vocational programs.  I participated in the nursing and networking programs, both of which showed me the impact of resilience, troubleshooting, utilizing resources, exploratory research and team work.
